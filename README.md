# sudoku-clojure

A modified copy of [David Nolen's](https://github.com/swannodette) [Sudoku solver](https://gist.github.com/swannodette/3217582) with some modifications from [Norman Richards'](https://github.com/orb) [fork](https://gist.github.com/orb/5884956).

I do not claim that any of my modifications are improvements. They are just the result of me tinkering and experimenting with the code in order to understand it better.
